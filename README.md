# Google-Business-Reviews-Script
A collection of Python scripts that use the Google Places API to collect detailed business information — including ratings, reviews, phone numbers, websites, and locations — and export the results to Excel. Built for high efficiency using asyncio and aiohttp, the scripts make concurrent API calls while staying within Google’s rate limits.
